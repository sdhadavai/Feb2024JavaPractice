//1.What is the purpose of a constructor in Java?
//Constructor is used to initialize instance variables in java

//2. How does a constructor differ from a regular method in Java?
	// Constructor is must be same as Class name whereas method name can be any
	// Constructor dosn't return anything even void whereas method may or may not return value
	// Constructor is called whenever we create object but for method we need to call explicitly
	

//3. Can a Java class have multiple constructors? If so, how are they differentiated?
	//Java can have multiple constructors, they can be overloaded constructors

//4. What happens if a constructor is not defined in a Java class?
	//If you donâ€™t implement any constructor in your class, the Java compiler inserts default constructor into your code on your behalf. 
	//You will not see the default constructor in your source code (the .java file) as it is inserted during compilation and present 
	//in the bytecode (.class file).

//Can a constructor call other methods or constructors within the same class?
	//yes we can call other methods and construction with the same class
